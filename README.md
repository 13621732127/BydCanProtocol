# BYD Battery-Box Premium LVS CAN Protocol
A "reverse engineering" of the BYD CAN protocol when used with Victron/Venus OS

The following information has been discovered between a BYD Battery-Box Premium LVS B019 / v1.17 and a Victron Venus OS v3.00. Battery-Box consist of 2 batteries in 1 tower (48V, 2* 78Ah).

CAN protocol is set to 500kBit/s (no FD).

### What is missing?

* Nr of modules blocking charge/discharge (not clear if supported)
* Alarms
* Events
* Consumed Watts
 
### Unclear

* Product ID (maybe 0x35F [00:01])

### How it looks like in Venus OS

## Comparison to the SMA protocol

After I finished documenting the protocol, I stumbled across a document about the SMA CAN protocol "Technical Information:
Connecting Batteries with external Battery Management System to SUNNY ISLAND 6.0H-11" ("SMA CAN protocol.pdf"). Here is a table with some of their CAN ids - which seem to be similar to BYD.
