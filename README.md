# BYD Battery-Box Premium LVS CAN Protocol

A "reverse engineering" of the BYD Battery-Box Premium LVS CAN protocol when used with Victron/Venus OS.

The following information has been discovered between a BYD Battery-Box Premium LVS B019 / v1.23 and a Victron Venus OS v3.00. Battery-Box consist of 2 batteries in 1 tower (48V, 2* 78Ah).

CAN protocol is set to 500kBit/s (no FD). All frames are sent with 8 bytes length (zero padded).

When emulating a BYD battery it seems to be sufficient to just periodically send the following frames with a `1000ms` delay:

1. 0x35E
2. 0x382
3. 0x35F
4. 0x35A
5. 0x35B
6. 0x351
7. 0x355
8. 0x356
9. 0x360
10. 0x372
11. 0x373
12. 0x374
13. 0x375
14. 0x376
15. 0x377
16. 0x378
17. 0x379

Things to note:

* Frames sent from Victron seem to be ignorable. We can just start sending the frames at any time.
* I did not check if the order of the frames is important. The above sequence seems to work.
* If frames are not sent completeley or properly, Venus OS tends to recognise the sender as "Pylontech" or "CAN bus BMS".
* If frames are not sent frequently enough, Venus OS interprets the sender as being disconnected (offering to *remove* the device).
* "Redetect battery" in Venus OS seems to send some frames to the "battery". It seems to be sufficient to just keep on sending the above frames (no other sequence needed).
* All information has been dumped on a Raspberry 4 with Venus OS v3.00 (as written above) and a RS485 CAN HAT with `candump`.
* Emulation of the battery has beend done from an Espressif ESP32 (and S2, S3) with a TJA1051 transceiver.

### What is missing?

* Nr of modules blocking charge/discharge (not clear if supported)
* Alarms
* Events
* Consumed Watts
 
### Unclear

* Product ID (maybe 0x35F [00:01])

### How it looks like in Venus OS

## Similarities with the SMA protocol

After I finished documenting the protocol, I stumbled across a document about the SMA CAN protocol "Technical Information:
Connecting Batteries with external Battery Management System to SUNNY ISLAND 6.0H-11" ("SMA CAN protocol.pdf"). Here is a table with some of their CAN ids - which seem to be similar to BYD.

*HiResSOC* 0x355 [04:07] and *Events* 0x35B do not seem to be supported on BYD.
